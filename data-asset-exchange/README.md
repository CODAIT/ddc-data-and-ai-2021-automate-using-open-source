### Data Asset eXchange

The [Data Asset eXchange (DAX)](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/) is a curated open data repository for free data sets from IBM Research and third parties. To learn more about DAX take a look at the official [Get started with the Data Asset eXchange](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-the-data-asset-exchange/) tutorial.

The [JupyterLab and Elyra](../jupyterlab-and-elyra/) tutorial utilizes the [NOAA Weather Data - JFK Airport](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/jfk-weather-data/) dataset, which is complemented by a set of notebooks that you can download and run [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/a7432f0c29c5bda2fb42749f363bd9ff?cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-exchanges-_-cloudreg).
